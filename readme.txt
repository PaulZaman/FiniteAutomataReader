Welcome to our project !

In order to run it, you will have to have pygame installed and run the file "main.py"

Our main algorithms that interest you are contained in the files:
- completion.py
- complementarization.py
- determinization.py
- minimization.py
- Finite_automata.py (class)

The other files contain functions and classes built for displaying all of this information on a window.
Our goal was to make a user friendly intuitive application so you should not have trouble navigating through pages
and menu screens.
If you have any types of questions, do not hesitate to ask us, and we will respond with pleasure.
